Create Laboratory should return LaboratoryId generated as well

For Delete Command handlers, find better way to return a sensible response rather than "Unit"

Update models so that we can have enums wherever required like status- Active or Inactive

If a model has reference to another contratc's primary key, check if it would make sense to have them referenced.

Add code to only add data when other required data is present, example- Technician if being added to a laboratory then that Lab should be present
If we dont want to add a technician to be added to the lab just now, then we can leave LaboratoryId as null 

Add fluent validations instead of Model states

Add caching
